# LanSharebotNG-2.0.9.3

Marlin config files for a modified Sharebot NG
I'm testing this new marlin version for a Sharebot NG modified as follow.

I've added (thanks to marlin firmware and some spare parts): 

1) PSU management (the original was coocked!!)
2) Filament runout (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003565228895.html)
3) DRV8825 for X, Y and Z 
4) Also I've added a BLTOUCH (clone) !!! (doesn't work very well btw but bed levelling isn't the main problem)

I've enabled some other marlin features to work better alone and with Octoprint (https://octoprint.org/)

Some problem ?! Z offset <> 0!!!
Check Z offset!!!
